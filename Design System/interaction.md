## Purpose

This page is the interaction layer of Creditra’s design system.

While the tokens page defines reusable visual values and the component page defines reusable interface building blocks, the interaction page should define how those components behave over time and in response to user actions.

This means the interaction page is responsible for documenting behavior, not just appearance.

It should help designers and developers answer questions like:

- what happens when a user hovers, focuses, presses, selects, or disables an element
- how feedback should appear during loading, success, warning, and error states
- how flows should move from one step to the next
- how overlays, forms, and confirmations should behave
- what patterns should feel immediate, subtle, delayed, blocking, or reversible

## Why This Page Matters

A design system is incomplete if it only documents static visuals.

Without interaction guidance, teams often end up with:

- inconsistent hover and focus behavior
- mismatched loading and feedback states
- screens that look aligned but behave differently
- modal and overlay patterns that feel unpredictable
- accessibility issues caused by missing state definitions

The interaction page exists to prevent those problems and make Creditra feel like one coherent product.

## Role In The Design System

The Creditra design system has three important layers that work together:

1. Tokens
2. Components
3. Interactions

Those layers answer different questions:

- tokens: what values are allowed
- components: what UI building blocks exist
- interactions: how those building blocks respond and transition

This page should therefore be treated as the behavioral source of truth for the Creditra UI system.

## What This Page Should Define

Even when a component is visually correct, it is not fully designed until its interaction behavior is defined. This page should document the shared rules for:

- state changes
- transitions
- feedback timing
- progressive disclosure
- confirmation patterns
- interruption patterns
- validation behavior
- form progression
- overlay behavior

In other words, this page should tell the team how the interface behaves when users do something.

## Core Interaction Areas This Page Should Cover

### 1. State Behavior

This page should define common state rules across components, especially for:

- default
- hover
- focus
- active or pressed
- selected
- disabled
- loading
- success
- warning
- error

These states should be standardized so a user gets the same behavioral cues across buttons, inputs, radios, cards, forms, and overlays.

### 2. Form Interactions

Creditra’s design system already has a strong form and input orientation, so this page should explain how users move through those flows.

Form interaction guidance should include:

- focus order and field progression
- helper text behavior
- validation timing
- error message placement
- inline vs blocking validation
- submit button behavior during loading
- post-submit success or failure feedback

Because Creditra appears to be workflow-heavy, form interactions are likely one of the most important areas in the system.

### 3. Feedback Patterns

The interaction layer should make it clear how the interface communicates system response.

This includes:

- loading indicators
- optimistic feedback
- confirmations
- warnings
- destructive confirmations
- success states
- retry states
- empty states

Feedback should feel consistent in tone, timing, and placement so users build trust in the system.

### 4. Overlay Behavior

Creditra’s component library already includes `Dialogue` and `Popover`, so this page should define how overlays behave, not just how they look.

Important overlay rules include:

- when to use dialog vs popover
- whether the interaction blocks the rest of the interface
- how the overlay opens and closes
- escape and outside-click behavior
- keyboard focus behavior
- how destructive or high-risk actions are confirmed

This is especially important for financial or workflow-based products where interruption patterns must feel deliberate and trustworthy.

### 5. Selection Behavior

The component library also includes radio patterns and radio cards. This page should define:

- how selection is shown
- whether selection is immediate or requires confirmation
- how selected and unselected states differ
- how option groups behave in keyboard navigation
- how more descriptive “card” choices differ from compact radio choices

Selection behavior should be predictable whether the choice appears in a simple settings form or a more decision-heavy product flow.

### 6. Motion And Transition Rules

Interaction design includes motion, but only when motion supports clarity.

This page should define:

- which transitions are allowed
- when motion is used to reinforce state change
- when motion should be subtle
- when motion should be avoided
- how loading and entrance animations behave
- how overlay and panel transitions should feel

The goal is not decorative animation. The goal is meaningful feedback and smoother comprehension.

## Recommended Documentation Scope

The interaction page should describe both:

- component-level interaction rules
- flow-level interaction rules

That means the page should not stop at “button hover” behavior. It should also include patterns like:

- multi-step form progression
- confirmation before irreversible actions
- interaction sequences inside dialogs
- error recovery flows
- loading-to-success transitions

This is where the page becomes especially useful to both product designers and frontend developers.

## Relationship To Other Design System Files

This file should be read together with the other design system docs:

- [fig_file.md](/Users/pv/Documents/Code/Creditra-Frontend/Design%20System/fig_file.md): explains the overall Creditra design system file on Figma
- [tokens.md](/Users/pv/Documents/Code/Creditra-Frontend/Design%20System/tokens.md): explains the reusable visual values used by the system
- [component.md](/Users/pv/Documents/Code/Creditra-Frontend/Design%20System/component.md): explains the reusable UI building blocks

This interaction file sits between components and product behavior. It explains how the reusable parts come alive during use.

## Recommended Structure For This Page

To make the interaction page useful over time, it should eventually be organized into these sections:

1. Interaction principles
2. Shared component states
3. Form behavior
4. Validation patterns
5. Loading and feedback patterns
6. Overlay behavior
7. Selection behavior
8. Motion guidance
9. Accessibility behavior

This structure keeps the page practical and avoids turning it into a vague set of design opinions.

## Suggested Interaction Principles For Creditra

The interaction page should reinforce a behavioral tone that matches Creditra as a product.

Recommended principles:

- clear: users should understand what is happening immediately
- calm: interactions should not feel noisy or overly animated
- deliberate: important actions should feel intentional
- responsive: the UI should acknowledge user input quickly
- trustworthy: status, risk, and feedback should never feel ambiguous

## Copy To Clipboard Pattern

Creditra should use one shared copy interaction across wallet addresses and transaction identifiers.

Pattern rules:

- Always show a visible `Copy` label so the affordance is discoverable without hover.
- Place the copy icon after the label in every instance.
- Use a real `button` for the action and keep it keyboard accessible.
- Keep the copied value visible next to the action, whether the value is truncated or full-length.
- Replace `Copy` with `Copied` for 2 seconds after activation, then revert automatically.
- Use a polite live region so assistive technology users hear the success state.

Implementation reference:

- Reusable component: `src/components/CopyToClipboard.tsx`
- Clipboard helper: `src/utils/clipboard.ts`

These principles are especially important if Creditra handles money, approvals, requests, or sensitive account actions.

## Accessibility Expectations

This page should explicitly document accessibility-related behavior, including:

- **Visible Focus States**: High-contrast rings for all interactive elements.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Logical tab order; `Escape` key closes modals/popovers.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Use of `aria-live` for status updates; descriptive `aria-label` for icon buttons.
- **Reduced Motion**: Avoid rapid movement; respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
- **Disabled States**: Ensure disabled buttons are identifiable but still readable.
- **Contrast**: Maintain 4.5:1 ratio for text and 3:1 for non-text UI components.
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum size of 44x44px for mobile accessibility.

Interaction documentation is one of the best places to capture accessibility behavior because many accessibility problems come from missing state definitions rather than missing colors.

## Recommended Rules By Pattern

## Governance Notes

This page should be updated whenever:

- a new interaction pattern becomes reusable
- a component gains a new state
- a workflow introduces a repeated confirmation or validation pattern
- motion or feedback behavior changes
- accessibility interaction rules are clarified

Interaction drift happens quickly when this information is not maintained centrally.

## Summary

The interaction page should function as the behavioral source of truth for Creditra’s design system.

Its job is to define how Creditra interfaces respond, transition, validate, confirm, and communicate. In practice, this means documenting:

- shared UI states
- form behavior
- loading and feedback patterns
- overlay behavior
- selection behavior
- motion guidance
- accessibility behavior

With the tokens page, component page, and Figma file overview already documented, this page completes the design-system documentation set by covering how Creditra’s interface should behave, not just how it should look.
